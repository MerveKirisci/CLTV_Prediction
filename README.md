# Project Steps ðŸ‘£
FLO wants to set a roadmap for sales and marketing activities. In order for the company to make a medium-long-term plan, it is necessary to estimate the potential value that existing customers will provide to the company in the future.

Since FLO makes both online and in-store sales, I have obtained the recency, frequency and monetary values along with the values of the customers and sales in this project, which I started by combining the sales with two different variables into a single variable. I used BG/NBD and Gamma Gamma models to estimate the Customer Life Time Value.
